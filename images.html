I spent a significant amount of time on exploring the city as well as hanging out with my friends, especially drinking. No surprisingly, we did a lot of incredible things, and I feel like I brought back so many childhood memories when I was there because I made life considerably more challenging than spending all day in my room as well as doing household chores. Big thanks to Next, Tory, Zena, and Eye that helped me accomplish this trip. Actually, it was an unexpected trip since my friend who I met in the university when I was in undergraduate would like to go to Niagara fall with his acquaintances, and my place is on the way there. He gave me a call and asked me to spend a night at my place. I simply said okay, and when they showed up, they began to feel extremly sleepy. We had had a conversation before they went to sleep, and they also asked me to join a trip with them if I don’t mind. I kept telling myself “No more excuses”, and I know exactly that I become frustrated by the tedium of daily living. Therefore, I just said “Yes” because I always wanted to travel the world even though I’ve got absolutely no money. I drove all the way to Boston because everyone was exhausted and felt asleep. Finally, I made a trip to Boston. Meanwhile, due to unrecognized sleep disorder, I experienced occasional sleep deprivation and memory and cognitive impairment. Okay, I think I’m going off the topic so let’s talk about my first-time visitor to Boston. In Boston, I eventually found authentic Thai dish, which is far better than other cities in the U.S I’ve been to given that I readily complained about the food in the city I live. Bostonians tend to wear far more fashionable clothes than people in other cities in the U.S due to the fact that there are too many shopping areas in Boston, where I am unable to recognize their names. For instance, Newbury Street, the most trendy area of the city, is not only an upscale shopping area, but also a retail destination given that people love shopping and hanging out there, and it’s an absolutely great street to stroll down. Bostonians buy items on impulse. There is no doubt about it. I also visited Boston University, Harvard University, MIT, which are prestigious universities in the world, and Boston public garden, which is one of the top-rated tourist attractions.
